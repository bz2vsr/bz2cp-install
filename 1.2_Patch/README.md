"BattlezoneIIupdateUS_1.2.exe" essentially just copies files to your Battlezone root folder, overwriting any existing ones.

If the EXE doesn't work for any reason, you can try copying the contents of the "bz2_1.2USupdate" folder directly into your Battlezone root folder.

Note: the "bz2_1.2USupdate" folder is not necessary for "BattlezoneIIupdateUS_1.2.exe" to run. It is simply provided as a fallback should the EXE fail.
