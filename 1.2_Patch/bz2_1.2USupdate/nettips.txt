   Version 1.2b24 . Last Updated: May 3, 2000. [What's new? Scroll down
   to the bottom.]
   
   Please note: This document makes reference to Battlezone 1.2, which
   has not officially been released yet. Thus, the features of that
   version are subject to change, and this document may not bear any
   resemblance to the official 1.2 patch. Do NOT email asking me where to
   find it, though a lot of fansites and message boards may have links to
   some leaked versions.
   
   BZ2 1.1 official patch now available! See
   http://www.pandemicstudios.com/bzii/ or
   http://www.planetbattlezone.com for download info. This should fix a
   number of problems noted; the 1.2 patch is in progress as well.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
  Ports, Firewalls, IPMasq/NAT/Internet Connection Sharing
  
   Battlezone2's network traffic runs under TCP/IP only. By default, it
   uses UDP ports 17770 and 17771. If you have a firewall in place
   between your computer and the network, you will have to allow traffic
   to freely travel in both directions along those ports. Consult the
   documentation for the firewall to allow that to happen.
   
   If you are using some sort of address-translation setup
   (IPMasq/NAT/Internet Connection Sharing), and are having troubles
   connecting to games, first check firewall settings. Additionally, you
   may want to manually forward traffic on the BZ2 ports to the computers
   in question. Once again, consult the documentation for your setup.
   
   Also, note that the patches to BZ2 may improve performance with joins
   under IPMasq/NAT/ICS. Check them out if you're having problems.
   
   BZ2 1.2 note Two additional TCP ports are used under 1.2: 17771 and
   17772 (based on default port # of 17770). You must enable them as well
   if you want to host a game inside of a firewall.
   
   Notes if hosting a game If you're behind a firewall or IP Masq/ICS/NAT
   (i.e. address translator) connection, you must open up or autoforward
   these ports to your machine. However, if you just want to be a client
   in a game hosted elsewhere, opening up stuff is not necessary. Why is
   this needed for a host and not a client? Simple: almost all these
   setups allow return traffic once an outgoing connection is initiated--
   the client finds a server, and says "Hello!" to it. When the server
   says "Join the fun," the firewall/translator can tell which machine it
   should return to, and allow the connection.
   
   However, firewall/translator systems are usually configured to drop
   connections they don't know anything about. If you're hosting a BZ2
   game on a machine H behind firewall/translator system F, if 'F'
   recieves the "Hello!" packet from any random machine on the net, it'll
   just throw it away. You need to change the configuration on F to allow
   those packets in, and send them on to H, where BZ2 is running and can
   handle those packets.

  In-game chat
  
   While you can chat in Battlezone 2 from the non-pausing escape-screen,
   it's faster and easier to simply hit the Enter key, type what you want
   to say, and hit Enter again.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
  In-game score info
  
   Control+Enter while playing BZ2 Multiplayer (though not with the
   Escape screen up) toggles the in-game score info on/off.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
  Chat commands
  
   While there's a lot of commands that you can execute with the GUI, at
   any of the 3 chatlines (shell, in-game Escape screen, in-game
   activated by 'Enter') have a number of commands that can be executed.
   Type "/help" (no "s) on a line by itself to see the mini-help, or use
   this list of commands.
   
   For commands that have a required parameter, it is marked below in
   []s; an optional parameter is in {}s.
   
   * /help
          Shows mini-help for most chat commands
          
   * /list
          Shows a list of players. It will look something like this:
          
Players in game:
C: (0) GSH [Local] [Server]

          The 'C:' up front identifies them as a team commander (if
          applicable). Next is a number in parentheses before the
          playername; it can be used as a shortcut to that player's name
          if you'd rather not type it out, e.g. "/info 0" or "/info GSH"
          will do the same thing. Finally, the local player (you) is
          identified, as well as the server by optional tags.
          
   * /info [Name/ID#]
          Shows info on a particular player. You must follow this command
          with either the player name, or the player number identifier.
          This command will have output like this:
          
Info on (0) Name: GSH [Local] [Server]
  Ping: 0 Deaths: 0 Kills: 0
  Commander of TeamGroup 1

          The info presented above should be self-explanatory.
          
   * /pinglist
          Shows ping times to all players. The pingtime is the average
          round-trip time in milliseconds for packets to get to the
          server and back. Thus, a ping of 500 is 1/2 of a second.
          
   * /leave {Explanation}
          Leaves the game. If an explanation message is also on that
          command line, it will be sent to all first.
          
   * /msg [Name/ID#] [Text]
          Sends a private message to the specified player. This is always
          sent to just that player, no matter what the Chat with
          All|Team|One is set to. Private messages appear on the sender's
          chat window as follows:
          
-> GSH: This is a private message sent to GSH

          and on the receiving end as:
          
GSH ->: This is a private message sent from GSH

   * /kick [Name/ID#] {Explanation}
          A server-only command; it removes that player from the game
          asap. An explanation may be given on the line, but it's not
          necessary.
          
   * /nick [NewName]
          Changes your in-game name to the new name specified. Spaces are
          not allowed in names, and the server may correct your name for
          legality and/or uniqueness.
          
   * /lockdown
          A server-only command; it prevents anyone from joining. Same
          functionality as the 'Joins: Deny' button in the shell and
          escape screen.
          
   * /openjoin
          A server-only command; it reverses the /lockdown and allows
          anyone to join. [Subject to passwords, player limits, etc].
          Same functionality as the 'Joins: Deny' button in the shell and
          escape screen.
          
   * /chatall
          Sets further chat messages to be sent to all players in the
          game. Same functionality as the 'Chat with All' interface
          buttons.
          
   * /chatteam
          Sets further chat messages to be sent to all teammates. If
          teamplay is off, this setting acts like 'Chat with All'. Same
          functionality as the 'Chat with Team' interface buttons.
          
   * /chatone [Name/ID#]
          Sets further chat messages to be sent to the specified player,
          without having to use the /msg command above. Same
          functionality as the 'Chat with One' interface buttons.
          
   * /chattype
          Reports what the current chat type is-- chat with All, Team, or
          a single player.
          
   * /commandlist
          Shows all commands recognized by the chat system.
          
   * /vehiclelist
          Shows what each player has chosen for a vehicle. If DM vehicle
          randomizing is on (see below), this option will not show the
          current vehicle, but only what they chose in the shell.
          
   * /ip [Name/ID#]
          Shows the IP address for a given player other than the local
          player. Note: clients can only see the IP address of the
          server; they have no ability to see any other clients' info.
          Servers can see the IP address of anyone.
          
   * /iplist
          Shows the IP addresses of all players in game; once again
          clients can only see the IP address of the server; they have no
          ability to see any other clients' info. Servers can see the IP
          address of anyone.
          
   * /gsoff
          Server-only option; stops responding to all Gamespy queries
          received. This will effectively prevent anyone from seeing (and
          therefore joining) the game. This option may be most useful for
          modem-servers who don't want the possibility of extra bandwidth
          being used by mid-game Gamespy queries.
          
   * /gson
          Server-only option, and the default. Allows BZ2 to respond to
          all Gamespy queries received. If /gsoff had previously been
          done, this'll allow the game to be visible once again.
          
   * /version
          [v1.2 only]Shows the game version and gamespy version being
          used.
          
   * /newserver [Name/ID#]
          [v1.2 only] Switches the hosting of the current session to the
          specified player, under the following conditions: (1) You must
          be the existing server to change the server, (2) You can not
          switch server to self (duh), and (3) All players must be
          playing the game (i.e. not in shell).
     _________________________________________________________________
   
  Sync Join
  
   Noted as 'Sync (Off) (On)' in the server's shell interface, this
   option allows the server to have all players start playing at the same
   time. In deathmatch, such an option is not normally chosen, but for
   strategy games, it may be desirable to do this. (Note: selecting
   another map will reset this option (and others) to what the map's
   defaults are.)
   
   If Sync Join is on, when the server launches, it'll wait for all other
   clients to launch as well. When all clients have reported in, the
   server will send the gamestate to them, and gameplay will begin.
   However, if a client (taking a nap or something) doesn't hit the
   'Enter Game' button within 120 seconds, they'll be kicked out.
   
   After the Sync Join is completed, by default, other players may join,
   as if Sync Join was off. Use the 'Joins: Allow/Forbid' option to
   prevent further joins after a sync join.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
  Vehicle Randomizer
  
   In Deathmatch (and similar, such as CTF and Loot) games, the server
   has the option of randomizing vehicles. The shell option looks like
   this: 'Vehicle [Fixed|Race|Random]'. (Note: selecting another map will
   reset this option (and others) to what the map's defaults are.) If the
   selection is 'Fixed', a new craft for a player will always be
   identical to their vehicle selection within the shell.
   
   If the selection is set to 'Race', then a random vehicle of the same
   race as that player's shell selection is chosen. (Of course, that
   randomizing is within the list of allowed vehicles by the server.) If
   the selection is set to 'Random', a random vehicle of any race allowed
   by the server is chosen.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
  Chat messages timeout
  
   By default, the in-game chat/messages window (not the escape screen)
   erases messages after 5 seconds. However, this is settable from the
   game console. While playing, hit Control-` (that's 2-keys, control and
   the key with ` and ~ marked on it) to pull up the console. [Chat
   messages are printed there as well, so some may just want to see that
   for a few seconds.] At the console, type
   'network.session.messagesappearforseconds 99' to set it to 99 seconds
   (what I prefer). The number can be anywhere from 1 to 9999 seconds;
   outside that range and it'll be reset to the default of 5 seconds. Hit
   Control-` to hide the console again.
   
   The console does have tab-completion (if you don't know what that is,
   you should use unix more) of commands. So, you can hit
   'net'[tab]'.ses'[tab]'.mes'[tab] to type that line a little faster.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
  Objectives window obscures chat
  
   If you hit 'o' during multiplayer, an empty transparent gray box will
   appear on the right side of the screen. [CTF may put an actual
   objective in it.] This objectives window will hide the chat window
   which appears in the same place. Hit 'o' again to turn it off.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
  Non-pausing servers
  
   By default, a BZ2 game will pause when a new client joins. This is
   designed to give modem servers a chance to have more bandwidth
   available to send the gamestate to new clients without being
   overloaded. However, if the game is hosted from a faster (i.e. ISDN,
   Cable Modem, DSL, T1, T3, OC-48) network connection, you may want to
   turn this off.
   
   Note: this information is provided to you without any guarantees of
   support or stability. It is an officially unsupported option, and
   should be used at your own risk. [In other words: don't gripe if it
   doesn't work for you. You're on your own.] To set this up, as a
   server, when you're in the MP shell (i.e. choosing a map/vehicle), go
   to the console (see above), and type the following
   'network.session.ivar10 1'. [The default setting is 0, i.e. pausing]
   That preference will be used until you quit and start another game.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
  Playing on a LAN Only
  
   BZ2 supports non-gamespy games among machines connected on a single
   subnet. To do this, all machines must have the same first 3 sections
   of their IP address (e.g. 192.168.1.*), and a valid subnet mask
   (usually 255.255.255.0 for such a class-C network). Next, from the
   game servers list window, there's a button in the top-right of that
   window marked 'Gamespy'. Press that button and it'll change to 'LAN
   Only'. [See command line options below for how to set this by default]
   This button must be set the same on all machines you want to play a
   game with.
   
   With a server set to LAN Only, it will not broadcast game information
   to Gamespy, and thus cannot be seen by a machine outside of your
   subnet. That is why a client must also be set to the LAN Only.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
  Commandline Options
  
   BZ2 supports several commandline options that Gamespy uses. To enter
   them, you'll either have to create a shortcut to bzone.exe, and edit
   that shortcut's properties, or add in the options via Start -> Run
   under Windows pointed at bzone.exe.
   
   * +name "Player Name"
          Sets the initial Multiplayer player name to the value
          specified. If there is a space or other character in the name,
          it must be enclosed in "s, as above. However, BZ2 will still
          ensure the name conforms to limits.
          
   * /lanonly
          Sets the initial setting of the Gamespy/LAN Only button to be
          LAN Only; omitting this option uses the default of Gamespy. You
          may still change this setting in-game, though.
          
   * +host [PortNum]
          Starts up BZ2 as a host (i.e. server) of a game, and places you
          in the Multiplayer Game Options shell screen. Valid port
          numbers to host on are 1024 through 65534; if the portnum
          specified is outside that range, the default of 17770 is used.
          BZ2 always uses 2 ports that are adjacently numbered; the
          number specified is the first.
          
   * +connect [i.p.add.ress:PortNum]
          Starts up BZ2 as a client to the game specified by IP address
          and port number; the port number should be the second BZ2 port
          number, usually 17771. For example, "+connect
          192.168.1.4:17771" tries to join the game at 192.168.1.4.
          
   * +password "TopSecretPassword"
          For either a client or a server (see above), this commandline
          parameter sets the password used when creating or joining that
          game.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
  Bandwidth considerations
  
   Since BZ2 is a client-server networking model, this optimizes each
   client's bandwidth, while pushes it towards the server. For a 4-player
   game with server 'S' and clients 'A', 'B', and 'C', the server must
   receive A's moves, and send them out to B and C. The server must send
   moves SBC to client A, SAC to client B, and SAB to client C. Thus, the
   server must send out N-1 moves per frame, where N is the number of
   players in the game. On the other hand, the clients only need to send
   their own moves towards the server.
   
   If at all possible, host a BZ2 game on the fastest network connections
   possible.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
  Changing groups, sending units
  
   In strategy, you can combine like units into one group. If you have a
   tank on the F1 group, and another tank on F3, you can unify them into
   the F1 group by pressing F3, releasing that key, then Control-F1. To
   split a group, say the F1 group, hit Control-F1 to open it up and you
   can access the individual units within.
   
   What's this mean for networking? In team strategy, you can send units
   back and forth between the commander and the wingmen the same way.
   Notice how there's icons for your allies, such as F10..F8? Select a
   group of units, then Control-F10 will send it to that ally. Not all
   units may be transferred-- recycler (vehicles) and constructors can
   not. But, you can give scavs to the wingmen in the early game so they
   can be escorted out to the scrap pools.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
  Resyncs
  
   If you get a 'Checking Gamestate' message (especially as the server),
   that means that someone (or multiple someones) are out of sync from
   the server. This can be caused by either a bug, or someone trying to
   use a cheat program (commonly called a 'trainer'). The cheat codes for
   BZ2 Singleplayer won't work in MP, and they'd only desynchronize the
   game for everyone. So, if you are thinking of cheating, go away.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
  Where's my tank!
  
   When you are ejected from a destroyed tank in BZ2 Deathmatch, you may
   be wondering where your next ride will be. As long as you're in the
   air, a new ship will not be created for you. This would be a good time
   to find a safe spot to land. After you land, or are killed as a pilot,
   a new craft will be spawned in somewhere near you. It may be behind
   you, so use your radar to find it. If it appears on top of water, and
   you feel you can't get to it, remember that you have a jetpack that
   can be set off underwater-- and once you enter the tank, it'll refill
   the jetpack.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
  Free for all Strat
  
   This is possible on certain strategy maps to have more than 2
   recyclers, but this requires turning off teamplay. Select a map like
   'ST: River4', which hits at 4 commanders, but you can't turn off
   teamplay. Like the no-pause servers above, when you're in the MP shell
   (i.e. choosing a map/vehicle) as the server, go to the console (see
   above), and type the following 'network.session.ivar11 0'. [The
   default setting is 1, i.e. teamplay locked to being on] If you select
   another map, it'll read the default value for that ivar out, and reset
   it.
   
   Most strategy maps shipped with BZ2 have only 2 spawnpoints and not
   enough scrap pools that it is highly recommended that you not do this
   on any map that doesn't suggest 4 commanders, i.e. River4 and Ground
   Four.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
  /poweruser commandline switch
  
   This option (not tweakable in the game; it must be added to the
   shortcut) was in previous versions, but really is most useful in
   version 1.2. This was my commandline switch to make the game work the
   way I want it to-- especially the first two options which put more
   text onscreen. For a short list of what it does:
   
   * Chat messages timeout is 99 seconds, not 5. Still editable with
          console command as above.
          
   * In-game score screen is on by default. Use Control-Enter to turn it
          on/off, as usual.
          
   * Server list shows much more information, such as:
          * All games reported back by Gamespy; a "(V)" is in the
          password column if the Gamespy version differs from your local
          one. Also, the 'Game Stats' box up top shows the actual GS
          version for a session.
          * Player list shows name, and 4 numbers; they are (in order)
          Deaths, Kills, Team number, Ping (host always has ping of -1)
          
   * Player disconnect/leave reasons are printed to the messages boxes,
          such as the Winsock reason, or movelag. (Movelag is when moves
          are not received 23-28 seconds after they're due). Note: this
          is most useful for a server to do; clients are not told
          disconnect/leave reasons unless it's their own. Note: messages
          like this are also sent to the console, so if you're at the
          game over screen, you can hit control-~ to turn on the console
          and see the reasons printed, then control-~ to turn it off
          again.
          
   * With /poweruser on, you can host a game with 14 players, not 8. This
          is most useful for some sort of lobby-style game which isn't
          launched. 14 players in an actual game would probably flood out
          modem users, but you can try it over a LAN.
          
   * No warnings printed on changing the playerlimit or unit limit above
          normal.
          
   * Probably some other tweaks as well.
     _________________________________________________________________
   
 
  Lag vs connection speed
  
   As measured in BZ2, lag is the difference between where your machine
   is, and where it should be, based on lockstep timesteps. It is not
   necessarily related to network connection speed-- a slow computer
   playing on a LAN can lag even though the LAN is physically capable of
   moving the data quickly enough. Much data is computed locally on every
   machine, and things must be drawn as well to keep up; you may not be
   able to speed up the gamestate calculations, but by lowering the
   graphic options, you may reduce lag.
   
   Lag is also affected by packet loss. A fast (Cable, DSL, T1, etc) line
   that loses every other packet is a worse candidate for playing the
   game on than a slower connection that actually delivers data reliably.
   While playing the game, hit escape to view the no-pause screen, and
   look in the ping column. Version 1.2 shows what percentage of move
   packets have had to be retransmitted, as a percentage. Thus, if that
   box says "152 (-3.4%)", the ping is 152ms, and 3.4% of recent (over
   about 30-40 seconds) movepackets have had to be retransmitted. If that
   loss percentage goes over about 15%, the connection is lousy and you
   should consider joining somehting with a more reliable connection.
   
   [/pinglist (see above) at the chatline also shows packet loss
   percentages; that % is always 0 for players in the shell as there are
   no movepackets transmitted to/from them to lose.]

  Version 1.2 Deathmatch Updates
  
   BZ2 1.2's Deathmatch01.dll supports a new game type, 'Race'. One map,
   racepluto.bzn is included as an example of this. There are 16
   checkpoints on a map you must reach to complete a lap, and the number
   of laps needed to win can be set in the shell. Besides the normal
   death/kills points system, one point is awareded for the first person
   to reach a checkpoint on a lap, and another point for completing a lap
   first. If killed as a pilot, you respawn back at the last checkpoint
   you completed.
   
   Tip: not all craft have many rear-firing weapons, so being the leader
   may mean you're getting shot up a lot. Also, on racepluto, if you take
   the longer routes around the outside, there's health powerups... it's
   all tradeoffs.
   
   How to make a race map: you must place 16 spawnpoints (odf name
   'pspwn_1' on the map, and give them team numbers from 0 thru 15.
   Everyone starts at the spawnpoint w/ team 0, proceeds to 1, and so on.
   For the .inf file for the map, you can either clone the racepluto.inf
   file (under addon); ivar7 is set to 5 for a normal race, and set to 6
   for vehicle-respawn race (don't eject as a pilot, you simply respawn
   in a new vehicle when you die).

  Version 1.2 Multiplayer Strategy Updates
  
   No real gameplay enhancements were made, though some features have
   been added for thugs and mapmakers.
   
   If the config variable 'network.seesion.ivar14' is set to 1 (the
   default), human players will get +1 point for killing an enemy AI
   unit. [And -1 for killing a friendly AI unit] Also, the config
   variable 'network.seesion.ivar15', when 1, will give +1 kill for
   killing an enemy AI unit. These settings can be overridden by the
   map's .inf file.
   
   For mapmakers, in BZ2 1.2 strategy, you can force a team (by number)
   to start in a specified place (no randomizing) by placing a spawnpoint
   (odf 'pspwn_1') down on the map with the specified team #. In teamplay
   games, teamgroup 1 is on team #1, and teamgroup 2 is on on team #6.
   
   Also, mapmakers can place some (optional) lines in the .inf to lock
   races:
   
   LockTeam1Race = "i"
   LockTeam2Race = "f"
   
   The first character of the lock is used to restrict their vehicle
   selection to vehicle odfs starting with that character. If there is no
   lock line specified, the commander of that team can pick any allowable
   vehicle.
   
   Also, for those making really big expansion packs, the strategy dll
   should allow about 26 possible races-- it uses the first character of
   the team commander's vehicle odf, and tacks on 'vrecy_m' for the
   recycler ODF. So, if the commander's odf is "kvscout", it'll spawn in
   a "kvrecy_m" for them to command. [This feature has been in BZ2 since
   1.0, but not documented until now.]

  Version 1.2 Multiplayer Instant Action (MPI) Mode
  
   BZ2 1.2 adds in a new multiplayer mode, with 1-4 humans on one team
   versus a computer-controlled team. These maps have 'MPI' by their name
   in the maps list, by default. When playing these maps, the playerlimit
   should remain at 4 (maybe 5, if you never want to switch commanders).
   The AI does get slightly tougher (more free scrap) as more humans
   play.
   
   Like a normal strategy game, the commander of the human teamgroup
   (always #1, the left group) picks their side's race. The teamgroup 2
   box is hidden (only CPU), but a button is in its place to select the
   CPU's race: ISDF or Scion. Thus, you can set up any the 4 combos of
   ISDF and Scion games.
   
   For mapmakers, it should be fairly easy to convert your Instant Action
   maps to MPI ones. First, place just one spawnpoint (odf 'pspwn_1') on
   the map, where you want the humans to start. Secondly, change the DLL
   referenced to 'mpinstant.dll'. Finally, set up the .inf file like any
   other MP map; copy an existing one for reference if you want.
   
   MPI mapmakers have some new things they can use to tweak things.
   Beyond the normal pathpoints used by an IA map, by using a naming
   convention, you can place down race-specific items based on the CPU or
   human race. These pathpoints are of the form 'mpic_fvscav_ivscav'
   (spawns a Scavenger on the CPU team, appropriate to the CPU race) and
   'mpih_fvtank_ivtank' (spawns a tank on the human team, appropriate to
   human race). The 'mpic' and 'mpih' parts are case sensitive, and you
   can place a number after those to make them unique, such as
   'mpic1_fvscav_ivscav' and 'mpic2_fvscav_ivscav'. Also, MPI mapmakers
   can completely override the default AIPs to get a different set of AI
   behaviors. I quote from the mpidunes.inf file, where this is commented
   on:
   
// Custom AIP name base. The MPInstant.dll will look for several files
// based on this base, with 3 characters tacked on. Those 3 are as
// follows: (1) CPU race (f=Scion, i=isdf), (2) Human race, (3) AIP
// Type (0=Start, 1-3 = begin game types, 'a' == anti-assault, 's' ==
// siege, 'l' = lategame).
//
// If an AIP file is not found, results may be unpredictable. [The AI
// will probably go to sleep, but haven't tested that.]
//
// For example, if svar3 == "foo", at the start of the game, the AIP
// used will be one of these 4 files:
// fooii0.aip  -- CPU ISDF, Human ISDF
// fooif0.aip  -- CPU ISDF, Human Scion
// foofi0.aip  -- CPU Scion, Human ISDF
// fooff0.aip  -- CPU Scion, Human Scion
// svar3 = "MyAIPs"  // Line commented out like this means default AIPs

   The MPI DLL does not allow up to 26 "races" like the strat dll does.

  Version 1.2 Changing the host
  
   As noted in the chatline commands above, v1.2 adds in the ability to
   change the server in the game. This can happen under the following 
   conditions: (1) You must be the existing server to change the server, 
   (2) You can not switch server to self (duh), and (3) All players must 
   be playing the game (i.e. not in shell).
   
   To switch servers, you can do one of the following things: (1) use the
   chatline command, as above. (2) Hit escape while playing, select a new
   player, and then click the "Switch Server" button, (3) Hit Alt-X to
   exit BZ2 completely, and it'll pop up a dialog box saying "Exit game
   or migrate server first" if it's possible to migrate the server. [And
   if migration is not judged possible, it'll only have Ok/Cancel
   buttons.] If you click on the "migrate" button, it'll pick a new
   server based on the best ping time, and do the migration before
   exiting.
